\description{
\code{fetch_lineup} returns the Lineup for matches in given AFL Round. Internally, it calls
a corresponding \verb{fetch_lineup_*} function that depends on the source given.
By default the source used will be the official AFL website.

\code{\link[=fetch_lineup_afl]{fetch_lineup_afl()}} can be called directly and return data from AFL website.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# Return data for whole season from AFL Website
fetch_lineup(2020)

# This is equivalent to
fetch_lineup(2020, source = "AFL")
fetch_lineup_afl(2020)

# Return AFLW data
fetch_lineup(2020, comp = "AFLW", source = "AFL")
fetch_lineup_afl(2020, comp = "AFLW")

# Not all sources have lineup data and will return a warning
fetch_lineup(2020, source = "footywire")
fetch_lineup(2020, source = "squiggle")


# Directly call functions for each source
fetch_lineup_afl(2018, round = 9)
