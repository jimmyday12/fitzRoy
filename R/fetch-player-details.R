#' Fetch Player Details
#'
#' @description
#' `fetch_player_details` returns player details such as date of birth, debut
#' and other details. The exact details that are returned will depend on which
#' source is provided.
#'
#' By default the source used will be the official AFL website.
#'
#' [fetch_player_details_afl()], [fetch_player_details_afltables()] and [fetch_player_details_footywire()]
#' can be called directly and return data from the AFL website, AFL Tables and Footywire respectively.
#'
#' The function will typically be used to return the current team lists. For historical data, you can use the `current` argument set to FALSE. This will return all historical data for AFL.com and Footywire data. AFLTables data will always return historical data.
#'
#' @param team team the player played for in the season for, defaults to NULL which returns all teams
#' @param current logical, return the current team list for the current calendar year or all historical data
#' @param comp One of "AFLM" (default) or "AFLW"
#' @param source One of "AFL" (default), "footywire", "afltables"
#' @param ... Optional parameters passed onto various functions depending on source.
#'
#' @return A Tibble with the details of the relevant players.
