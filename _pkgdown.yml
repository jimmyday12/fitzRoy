  title: Easily Scrape and Process AFL Data
  description: An easy package for scraping and processing Australia Rules Football (AFL)
    data. 'fitzRoy' provides a range of functions for accessing publicly available data 
    from 'AFL Tables' <https://afltables.com>, 'Footy Wire' <https://www.footywire.com> and
    'The Squiggle' <https://squiggle.com.au>. Further functions allow for easy processing, 
    cleaning and transformation of this data into formats that can be used for analysis.

  - title: Main Fetch Functions (AFLM and AFLW)
    desc: >
     These are the main functions to return data. They all have consistent 
     arguments and APIs. You can access both Mens and Womens data providing you 
     use the right source. 
    contents:
    - '`fetch_ladder`'
    - '`fetch_results`'
    - '`fetch_fixture`'
    - '`fetch_player_stats`'
    - fetch_lineup
    - fetch_player_details
    - fetch_coaches_votes
    
  - title: Other
    desc: >
      These are other functions that return data but don't fit into the normal 
      fetch functions.
    contents:
      - fetch_squiggle_data
      - get_fryzigg_stats
      - fetch_betting_odds_footywire
      - get_afl_colour_palettes
      - calculate_coaches_vote_possibilities
      - plot_score_worm
      - plot_score_worm_totals
      - fetch_score_worm_data

  - title: Internals
    desc: >
      Internal functions are mostly used internally by the package and won't be 
      useful to end users.
    contents:
      - '`replace_teams`'
      - '`replace_venues`'
      - '`get_aflw_cookie`'
      - '`get_afl_cookie`'
      - team_abr_afl

  - title: Superseded
    desc: >
      Superseded functions have been replaced by new approaches that we believe
      to be superior, but we don't want to force you to change until you're
      ready, so the existing functions will stay around for several years.
    contents:
    - '`get_fixture`'
    - '`get_afltables_stats`'
    - '`get_footywire_stats`'
    - '`update_footywire_stats`'
    - '`get_footywire_betting_odds`'
    - '`get_match_results`'
    - '`return_ladder`'
    - '`get_fryzigg_stats`'
